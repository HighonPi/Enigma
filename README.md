# Enigma
This is the github repository for an Enigma machine emulator.The plan of action is yet to be decided.
For working of an Enigma machine refer https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106j/handouts/36-TheEnigmaMachine.pdf
For a basic idea of the gui look at https://piotte13.github.io/enigma-cipher/.
For a detailed overview look at https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106j/handouts/37-Assignment5.pdf
At the end of webpage from the link in line 5,a small idea is proposed to build a bombe decryption machine,we can also look into that much later ig.
